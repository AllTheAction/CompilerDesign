My story
--------
I have been in school all my life.
Previously, I was a postdoc at MIT.
At Oregon State University, I earned my Master's and Ph.D in Computer Science.
At Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, I earned a B.A. in Math and Computer Science.
I am originally from Texas.

## What is the professor's teaching philosophy?
Tell me and I'll forget; show me and I may remember; involve me and I'll understand. --- Chinese proverb

- [Schools are broken](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U).
- [Lectures don't work](http://www.consulting-business.com/why-schools-are-broken-and-reading-sucks-how-to-really-learn.html).

Let's do better. Principles:

- Information is abundundant. Attention is scarce. To get the most from information, act on it.
- [Learning is doing](http://www.engines4ed.org/hyperbook/nodes/NODE-120-pg.html).
- Teaching is feedback that [addresses misconceptions](http://www.veritasium.org/).
- [Assignments should matter](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/docs/StopStealingDreamsSCREEN.pdf).
- Textbooks [should be free](http://whyopenedmatters.org/) in every sense of the word.
- [Always question authority](http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/prologue.htm). [Always suestion the hierarchy](http://www.unwelcomeguests.net/Disciplined_Minds).
- [Test beforehand](http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html), not just afterward.
- We all can and should [teach and learn from each other](http://mazur.harvard.edu/research/detailspage.php?rowid=8).

## What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?
[The fear of failure prevents us from doing great things](http://www.ted.com/talks/regina_dugan_from_mach_20_glider_to_humming_bird_drone.html). --- Regina Duncan

If you're not failing 90% of the time, then you're probably not working on sufficiently challenging problems. --- Alan Kay

As long as you contribute to class, you cannot and will not fail. But you must contribute.

Of course, the [first time we try anything, we tend to suck at it](http://marshallbrain.com/million6.htm). So, to [do great things](#how-do-i-make-the-world-better), be prepared to be wrong.

[If you are not prepared to be wrong, you will never come up with anything original](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html). --- Kevin Robinson

## How can I make the world better?
Contribute something that matters. Don't just sit there.

Don't know what to contribute?

- Ask yourself. What do you wish was better?
- Ask around. What do people want?

Don't know how to do it? 

- Research online and offline.
- Find people who know how.
- Do it, and share what you learn ([especially what didn't work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY_o4A1wzsg)).
- Develop [autonomy, mastery, and purpose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc).
