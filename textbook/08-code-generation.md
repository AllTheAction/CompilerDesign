Code generation
===============

### What is code generation?
Code generation is the final [compiler phase](#what-are-the-phases-of-a-compiler).
It produces code in the target language, which is typically a machine language (e.g., x86, arm), but may be assembly or even a high-level language.

The code generator is distinct from the [parser](#what-is-a-parser) and the [translator](#what-is-a-translator).
