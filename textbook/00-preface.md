> Tell me and I'll forget; show me and I may remember; involve me and I'll understand. --- Chinese proverb

This book aims to teach the concepts of compiler design Socratically through questions and follow-up.
It keeps definitions and explanations brief, because these alone do not teach.
Instead, the book primarily focuses on showing examples, counterexamples, and identifying misconceptions.
Examples and counterexamples illustrate terms so you may remember.
Understanding material involves clearing misconceptions, which is why the book identifies them.
