<p>Although we have all used compilers, to make the most of them we should understand how they work.</p>
<p>In this course we will make contributions that matter.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-discrete-mean"><a href="#TOC">What does discrete mean?</a></h2>
<h2 id="what-is-a-set"><a href="#TOC">What is a set?</a></h2>
<p>An unordered, possibly infinite, collection of unique objects.</p>
<p>Examples: - {apple,pear,banana} is a set. - {apple,apple,pear} is not a set, because apple is not unique. - The integers form an infinite set. - {1,2,3} is the same set as {3,1,2}, because order does not matter.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-string"><a href="#TOC">What is a string?</a></h2>
<p>A sequence of characters.</p>
<p>For example: - &quot;This is a string&quot; - &quot;Strings are surrounded by quote marks&quot; - &quot;This string&quot; is not &quot;this string.&quot; Case and punctuation matter.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-sequence"><a href="#TOC">What is a sequence?</a></h2>
<p>An ordered collection of objects.</p>
<p>Examples: - {apple,pear, banana} is a sequence. - {apple, apple, pear} is a sequence, because objects need not be unique. - {1,2,3} is different from {3,1,2}, because order matters.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-character"><a href="#TOC">What is a character?</a></h2>
<p>A symbol in an alphabet.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-alphabet"><a href="#TOC">What is an alphabet?</a></h2>
<p>A finite set (of symbols).</p>
<p>Examples: - Roman, Greek alphabet - Numerals - ASCII - Unicode</p>
<h1 id="compilers"><a href="#TOC">Compilers</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-compiler"><a href="#TOC">What is a compiler?</a></h2>
<p>A compiler translates from a source <a href="#what-is-a-language">language</a> to a target language.</p>
<p>Examples: - GCC, Clang, Visual C++ translate C into machine code - LaTeX, Pandoc translate document markup into PDF, HTML, etc.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-language"><a href="#TOC">What is a language?</a></h2>
<p>A set of strings.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I love you dearly!&quot; is in English.</li>
<li>&quot;Love I dearly you!&quot; is not in English, despite the English words.</li>
<li>&quot;int main() { return 0; }&quot; is in C.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-a-formal-grammar"><a href="#TOC">What is a formal grammar?</a></h2>
<p>A formal grammar is a set of syntax rules that determine what combination of characters make up a valid string within a formal language.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-containment-hierarchy"><a href="#TOC">What is a containment hierarchy?</a></h2>
<p>A containment hierarchy is a hierarchical ordering of nested sets that are uniquely different from each other. There are two types of containment hierarchy, one where the parent includes its children (subsumptive), and the other where the parent is made up of its children (compositional).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Subsumptive:</b> all cars are vehicles, but not all vehicles are cars, so the vehicle class subsumes the car class.</li>
<li><b>Compositional:</b> cars contain engines and tires, so the car class is composed of the engine and tire objects. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-Chomskys-hierarchy"><a href="#TOC">What is Chomsky's hierarchy?</a></h2>
<p>Chomsky's hierarchy is a <a href="#what-is-a-containment-hierarchy">containment hierarchy</a> of classes of <a href="#what-is-a-formal-grammar">formal grammars</a>. Chomsky's hierarchy is used to classify formal grammars into four types.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Type-0: Recursively enumerable</b></li>
	<ul>
	<li>Includes all grammar which generates languages that can be recognized by a Turing machine automaton.</li>
	</ul>
<li><b>Type-1: Context-sensitive</b></li>
	<ul>
	<li>Includes all grammar which generates languages that can be recognized by a linear bounded automaton.</li>
	</ul>
<li><b>Type-2: Context-free</b></li>
	<ul>
	<li>Includes all grammar which generates languages that can be recognized by a pushdown automaton.</li>
	</ul>
<li><b>Type-3: Regular</b></li>
	<ul>
	<li>Includes all grammar which generates languages that can be recognized by a finite state automaton.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>All regular languages are context-free, but not all context-free languages are regular. The relationship between types is subsumptive, where type 2 includes type 3, type 1 includes type 2, and type 0 includes type 1. </p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-regular-language"><a href="#TOC">What is a regular language?</a></h2>
<p>A regular language is a language that can be expressed with regular expressions. In <a href="#what-is-Chomskys-hierarchy">Chomsky's hierarchy</a> a formal language would be composed of type-3 grammar.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-regular-expression"><a href="#TOC">What is a regular expression?</a></h2>
<p>The empty set, empty string, and character are regular expressions. If a and b are regular expressions, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>ab is a regular expression that matches a followed by b</li>
<li>a|b is a regular expression that matches a or b</li>
<li>a* is a regular expression that matches a zero or more times</li>
