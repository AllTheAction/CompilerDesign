Compilers
---------

### What is a compiler?
A compiler translates from a source [language](#what-is-a-language) to a target language.

Examples:

- GCC, Clang, Visual C++ translate C into machine code
- LaTeX, Pandoc translate document markup into PDF, HTML, etc.

### What is a language?
A [set](background.md#what-is-a-set) of [strings](background.md#what-is-a-string).

Examples and counterexamples:

- "I love you dearly!" is in English.
- "Love I dearly you!" is not in English, despite the English words.
- "int main() { return 0; }" is in C.

### What is an interpreter?

### The C compiler is written in C. How can that be?

### How do compilers work?

Regular languages
-----------------

### What is a regular language?

### What is a regular expression?
The empty set, empty string, and character are regular expressions.
If a and b are regular expressions, then:

- ab is a regular expression that matches a followed by b
- a|b is a regular expression that matches a or b
- a* is a regular expression that matches a zero or more times

### What is a finite automaton?

### What is an nondeterministic finite automaton?

### What is a deterministic finite automaton?
