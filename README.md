Compiler Design
===============

This course is about the design of `compilers <index.md>`_ (hence the
name). To participate, `master the pre-requisites first, or along the
way <background.md>`_. `Use git and github <git.md>`_.

Contributions we will make:

-  We `learning by
   doing <[http://www.engines4ed.org/hyperbook/nodes/NODE-120-pg.html>`_](http://www.engines4ed.org/hyperbook/nodes/NODE-120-pg.html)),
   so we will build `a derivative-based parser combinator library in
   C <parser-combinator-project.md>`_.
-  We also `learn by
   teaching <[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching>`_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning\_by\_teaching)),
   so we will develop `open educational
   resources <open-educational-resources.md>`_.

`Meet the professor <professor.md>`_.
